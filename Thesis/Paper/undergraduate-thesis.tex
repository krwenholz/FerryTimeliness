\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Ferries (as in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:basicferry}} present an interesting 
opportunity to examine a complex traffic system filled with data and affecting 
the lives of many individuals. This paper will discuss a new approach to predicting 
the timeliness of ferries using a support vector machine.  An overview of how 
support vector machines work and their complications in real world use will 
introduce the discussion of how this powerful construct presents a powerful and 
intuitive model for tackling the massive data associated with ferries.  A 
functioning model is developed to examine the complexities of this
approach, the practicality, and as a means of exploring some of the data.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.15]{images/ferry.jpg}
  \caption{A prototypical WSDOT ferry on its route.}
  \label{fig:basicferry}
\end{figure}

We will attempt to predict the tardiness of ferries, where tardy is 
defined as no less than three minutes later than the
initial (at day's beginning) scheduled arrival or departure time. This definition
of tardiness was chosen to allow for a non-trivial number of tardy events 
(more than 10% in the data) and to remain practical: i.e. someone could use the
restroom in three minutes time or otherwise make use of that information. The 
Washington State Department of Transportation's ferry system in the Pacific
Northwest served as the source for all data. As will be discussed later on, 
this ferry system is notoriously on time with over 95\% of trips being on 
schedule (within one minute). %TODO: CITATION
This system is of particular interest for its sheer volume of passengers: 
22 million per year. %TODO:CITATION
The volume lends itself well to this project's goals of using data mining. 
% TODO: better transition sentence is needed



\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelims}
Since the goal of the project was to use a large data set for machine learning 
and to develop a model for possibly predict future ferry tardiness, two approaches
popular in available implementations and the literature were initially evaluated:
artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). These two 
approaches fit into the
category of \textbf{supervised learning}: labeled (known) data is fed into an
algorithm that learns to make better predictions through comparing its own 
predictions to the labeled data set. ANN and SVM are often considered to be
very similar in the problems they attempt to tackle, especially since each can
be used as a linear classifier: a function taking in some object and determining 
a class to which it belongs. Rather than considering tardiness as a spectrum of
degrees, we approach tardiness as a binary feature: late or not. This conceptually
simplifies our problem.  
% TODO: Discuss airlines tardiness example as a motivator for choosing SVM
% and formulating problem as classification
If artificial neural networks and support vector 
machines can both solve classification problems, however, which are we supposed
to choose?

Byvatov et al examine the differences of the two approaches for classifying drugs
\cite{byvatov2003comparison}. While their model certainly isn't for a ferry 
system, their discussion suggests data sets with many features (an aspect of the 
ferry model we discuss later) are better suited for SVM, and they also find little
difference in the predictions of ANN and SVM. Most importantly, their conclusion,
and that of their references, is the two approaches are complementary. Each 
tool catches different cases, but the results are comparable in each approach,
and SVM may even require less ``tweaking''.

Support vector machines are also more intuitively motivated. Consider mapping the
features of a ferry trip (time of departure, weather, boat name, etc.) into a
coordinate plane.  Now, if we do this for all the points in our training set,
we can also attach labels to the points (late or not, as in 
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:basic_svm_data}}). In two dimensions, we
could try drawing a line through the late and not-late points to separate them.
This line is simply a hyperplane in higher dimensions, and SVM has its theoretical
underpinnings based on the idea of drawing this hyperplane optimally. In 
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:training_hyperplanes}}, we show a sample training of a 
simple support vector machine.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{images/basic_svm_data.png}
  \caption{A simple example of a separating line for tardiness (i.e. hyperplane). 
      Each data point (or instance) has features $X_1$ and $X_2$.}
  \label{fig:basic_svm_data}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{images/Svm_separating_hyperplanes.png}
  \caption{As in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:basic_svm_data}}, we are trying to separate
    labeled points with a line. A SVM does this iteratively, meaning line $H_1$
    would be the first pass, $H_2$ the result of refitting, and $H_3$ the final 
    classifier produced by the SVM.}
  \label{fig:training_hyperplanes}
\end{figure}

SVM are used as the tool for finding a linear classifier in this project mostly
for ease of understanding and the possibility for use in regression analysis
(a topic discussed in \cite{chang2011libsvm}).
