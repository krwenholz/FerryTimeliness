## FerryTimeliness ##
An entire project for predicting the timeliness of ferries.  Most of this is
dedicated to documenting the process of my Senior Project, but eventually
there will be a "FinalProduct" directory with the nicest of the nice stuff.  
Or, if I'm really on top of my game, this whole thing will get cleaned up with
only the Git history to tell you how ugly it once was.
