## FerryTimeliness ##
An entire project for predicting the timeliness of ferries.  Most of this is
dedicated to documenting the process of my Senior Project.  You can find the
source I wrote in the src directory.  Other points of interest may include

* [Reports](https://github.com/krwenholz/FerryTimeliness/tree/master/Reports)
for the weekly reports I wrote about this project.
* [notes](https://github.com/krwenholz/FerryTimeliness/tree/master/notes) for
a cornucopia of brain-vomit.  It's a good place for links to where I found data
and information.
* [TrainingSuccess](https://github.com/krwenholz/FerryTimeliness/tree/master/TrainingSuccess.mkd)
to see how my models panned out.
* [HOWTO](https://github.com/krwenholz/FerryTimeliness/tree/master/HOWTO.mkd)
will teach you all about the process of using the code I wrote (at least what
was my final process).
* If you want to use the actual SVM, head to the [LibSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)
pages for more information.  The project is reasonably documented, and with my
HOWTO, it should be even easier to use.
* For any of the actual data, you can contact me.  I tried to keep it out of the
git repo for space reasons (maybe not successful at first) and for any legalish
hassles.

:+1: Enjoy!
