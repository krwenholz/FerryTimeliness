# Report for week ending November 9th #

## Brief Checklist of Accomplishments ##
* 60.5% accuracy on the first run.  Not too bad, but I want to get up to ~75%.
This may be possible with some whittling down of extraneous features.

## Design Decisions Being Made ##
* I'm removing wet bulb temperature, since the combination of dry bulb and humidity
predicts wet bulb.

## On track? ##
